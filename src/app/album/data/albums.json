            "strDescriptionEN": "Hot Fuss is the debut studio album by Las Vegas-based American rock band The Killers, released on June 7, 2004 in the United Kingdom and on June 15, 2004 in the United States. The album was recorded between February and November 2003 at Cornerstone Studios in Berkeley, California, with Mark Needham and Jeff Saltzman; and in Las Vegas with the help of Corlene Byrd. Many of the tracks were originally recorded as demos, which the band decided to keep for their spontaneity. They did, however, have some tracks remixed by Alan Moulder at Eden Studios in London.\nHot Fuss is mainly influenced by New Wave and post-punk artists such as New Order, The Cure, Morrissey (with and without The Smiths), Duran Duran, and The Cars. Other influences include David Bowie, U2, Oasis, Smashing Pumpkins, and Lou Reed.\nThe album includes the second and third parts of the so-called Murder Trilogy, \"Midnight Show\" and \"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\". The first part, \"Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf\", appears on The Killers' B-sides and rarities compilation, Sawdust.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "First Impressions of Earth is the third album by the American indie rock band The Strokes. It was released in January 2006 (see 2006 in music), having been preceded by lead single \"Juicebox\" some weeks earlier. It is also the first album by The Strokes to have a Parental Advisory Label.\nThe album was recorded over a ten-month period. The Strokes initially set out to record it with Gordon Raphael, the producer of their first two albums. Later on, guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. introduced them to Grammy Award-winning producer David Kahne (Paul McCartney, Tony Bennett, Sublime), who stepped in to collaborate with Raphael. However, the collaboration was not working out and so Raphael stepped down. As a result, the majority of the album was produced by Kahne.",

            "strReview": "When The Strokes first emerged critics and public pounced on their debut as the start of a new rock golden age. The sequel, the underwhelming and repetitive Room On Fire, led many to realise they had over-estimated the New Yorkers.\nIf the brilliant lead single \"Juicebox\" seemed to indicate Julian Casablancas was broadening his musical horizons, it's misleading. First Impressions Of Earth is, with the odd exception, very much Strokes business as usual.\nHowever, the opening three tracks show the band at their best. \"You Only Live Once\" is a brash and winning opener, sounding as vibrant as a lost Blondie classic.\nNick Valensi provides thrilling guitar work throughout. It's Casablancas singing and songwriting that let's the side down, and with fourteen songs he gives himself a lot of space to disappoint.\nIf this undeniably talented band are to repay that initial excitement, their fourth album is going to have to offer a great deal more consistency and invention than on display here.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Kooks arrived fully formed in 2006, for their debut sounds like the work of a band well into its career: the confidence with which the foursome from Brighton play and the abandon with which Luke Pritchard sings; the witty songcraft and deft arrangements; the drama and fervor they unleash from the very first notes and carry through to the end. They display maturity but also play with the fervor of kids and project a wide-eyed charm that is very endearing. On most of Inside In/Inside Out, the band sounds like a more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times. Along with these modern kinships and influences, the band is heavily indebted to classic rock. Traces of Thin Lizzy's romantic lyricism pop up on tracks like \"Eddie's Gun,\" and so does a bit of post-punk spikiness on \"You Don't Love Me,\" some Dexys singalong booziness on \"She Moves in Her Own Way,\" and a hint of jam-band funk on \"Match Box.\" Quite varied influences, and in the end the band sounds like The Kooks and no one else. A nice and unique sound doesn't mean much without some songs to fill it out, and The Kooks deliver plenty of memorable tunes. \"Eddie's Gun,\" \"See the World,\" the unfortunately named \"Jackie Big Tits,\" and \"Ooh La\" are very strong and, taken together, equal the output of just about any pop/rock band around in 2006. The only song that falls flat is the over-long reggae-rocker \"Time Awaits.\" It's the only track that breaks the four-minute mark, and it shows that The Kooks' strength isn't stretching out and jamming; their chops are best suited for short, sharp blasts of invigorating pop/rock. When they stick to that, The Kooks are an exciting, very promising band, and Inside In/Inside Out is an excellent debut.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Favourite Worst Nightmare is the second studio album by English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys that was first released in Japan on 18 April 2007 before being released around the world. Recorded in east London's Miloco Studios with producers James Ford and Mike Crossey, the album was preceded by the release of new single \"Brianstorm\" on 16 April 2007. In its first week following release the album sold over 220,000 copies, emulating Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not in going straight to number one in the UK Albums Chart, albeit selling 100,000 copies fewer than their record-breaking debut. Favourite Worst Nightmare's first day sales of 85,000 outsold the rest of the Top 20 combined, while all twelve tracks from the album entered the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart in their own right. In the USA, the album debuted at number seven, selling around 44,000 copies in its first week. The album has since gone 2x platinum in the UK and the album was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize. At the 2008 BRIT Awards it won Best British Album.\n\nIn comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album has been described as \"very, very fast and very, very loud,\" being seen as \"more ambitious, heavier...and with a fiercely bright production\". Reflecting the band's travels around the world more than local stories of the first record, FWN is a \"faster, meaner\" album. The album arguably has influences from The Smiths - \"twanging, quasi-ambient backdrops...and Turner's voice [...] crooning like Morrissey or Richard Hawley.\" Matt Helders said \"Conor McBride's superfast supersmooth guitar sweeps and bone-crunching C-tuned guitar riffs were a major influence on this album.\" As a result, the drum rhythms of Helders and bassist Nick O'Malley have drawn comparisons to the Eighties funk band ESG. The band's love of classic films also influences their new style. For example, the organ at the beginning of the album's final track, \"505\" is taken directly from Ennio Morricone's soundtrack for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (where Angel Eyes enters before the final standoff).",

Six jours plus tard, l'album atteint la première place des charts britanniques. Chose rare dans le monde du rock, la totalité des chansons de l'album se placent dans le top 200 grâce au nombre jamais atteint de téléchargements et de pré-commandes  : depuis Brianstorm (sorti en single) à la 7e place à If You Were There, Beware à la 189e. Fluorescent Adolescent et 505 se classent dans le top 75.\n\nLe troisième single de l'album, Teddy Picker, paraît le 3 décembre 2007 et se classe 20e ; le disque ne reste qu'une semaine dans le top 40, devenant ainsi le single du groupe avec le moins bon parcours dans les charts.",

Could this be the moment where Alex Turner falls flat on his face and admits that maybe, just maybe, he should have spent more time appeasing an interview-thirsty media frenzy? Not bloody likely – this is an absolute treasure.\n‘’Brianstorm’’, a volcanic signal of intent, ‘’Teddy Picker’’ and ‘’D Is For Dangerous’’ give the album a rocketing lift-off. Ascending guitars do battle as the band’s much promised darker and heavier side comes to the fore. With a succession of jaw-dropping riffs, you are engulfed by a fever that was last induced by ‘’The View From The Afternoon’’ and ‘’Ritz To Rubble’’.\nFavourite Worst Nightmare illustrates a great degree of maturity in many ways. Turner’s mastery of lyrics hits home more than before and is sure to connect with an older audience who felt excluded by Whatever People Say I Am… And wherever Turner, fit to burst with aggression and sexual frustration, has raised the bar, drummer Matt Helders has sailed over it with a virtuoso performance.\nIn a practically chorus-less 40 minutes, it’s difficult to find an ineffective track in a many-faced record. The slowest of songs, ‘’Only Ones Who Knew’’, could be curtailed by a minute but still makes for a great transition towards a slick finale. From ‘’Do Me A Favour’’ – the ultimate break-up track– to the cheeky-cheating ‘’Do The Bad Thing’’, the denouement is special. Final track ‘’505’’ is the perfect bookend to sit opposite the brash ‘’Brianstorm’’ with a tenderness sure to surprise.\nExpect green-eyes from all corners (from The Strokes through to Klaxons) as the Monkeys continue their pursuit of perfection. Rather scarily, Favourite Worst Nightmare has surpassed previous heights scaled by the band and will have many a rival tossing and turning in their sleep for years to come.",

            "strReview": "If you believe what you read, Franz Ferdinand are Glasgow's answer to The Strokes. Only they don't really sound like The Strokes. Or look like them. Or have much in common with them at all. It's all a bit confusing, really. Surely this, their eponymous debut album, can't live up to comparisons with Is This It? Or can it?\nWell...yes, frankly. Glasgow's next big things have come up with a cracking debut, taking elements from all over the place. Funky guitar playing that would make Nile Rodgers proud; wonderful harmonised vocals; a simple-but-effective drum sound; sexy, throbbing basslines; and a keyboard sound so cheesy that you could bait a mousetrap with it. And it works. I'm not much of a dancer, but this album makes me want to get up and do a little jig - all hips, elbows and twitchy head movements. A Jarvis Cocker impersonation, if you like...\nThere's not a bad track on the album, so trying to pick standout tracks is more or less arbitrary. My current favourites are \"The Dark Of The Matinee\" for its strange tale of art-school passion, and the fact that it name-checks Terry Wogan (!). And \"Come on Home\" because it's got great lyrics and a wonderfully lame keyboard sound. (An hour ago my favourites were \"Michael\" and \"Tell Her Tonight\" - give me another hour and I'll have changed my mind again, I'm sure...)\nAt only 38 minutes long Franz Ferdinand may not be a particularly long album, but it is a masterpiece of funky, punky, suave cool from the first track to the last. Alex Kapranos and co. have got the formula just right. A pinch of this and a smattering of that from here, there and everywhere. \"Come on Home\" and \"Auf Acshe\" could be distantly related to Blondie's \"Atomic\" while \"Tell Her Tonight\" sounds a bit like \"Boogie Nights\" (in a good way). The whole album sounds sort of familiar. Despite this, it's always unmistakably Franz Ferdinand. But that's usually the way with great albums isn't it?",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Get Born is the debut studio album by Australian rock band Jet. It was released on 14 September 2003 and has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide. The album includes one of Jet's most popular songs, \"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\".\n\nJet entered the Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles with Dave Sardy to produce their debut album Get Born. Sardy had previously produced records for Marilyn Manson and The Dandy Warhols. The band left the recording studios halfway through recording the album to fly back to support the Rolling Stones on their 2003 Australian tour.\n\n\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\", from this album, was voted number one in the 2003 Triple J Hottest 100. Get Born also has a song, \"Timothy\", dedicated to guitarist Cameron Muncey's brother, who died when he was a baby (the song has also been remixed for American rapper Timbaland's 2009 album Shock Value II). The track \"Radio Song\" was written about when they were an unsigned band in Melbourne seeking attention, and \"Rollover DJ\" was written about the difficulty they encountered when trying to play gigs because of the takeover of dance music.\n\nThe album derived its name from the video for Bob Dylan's song \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\".",
